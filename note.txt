About Us
Gedhe Endhase: Where Coffee Meets Courage, and Waste Becomes Wonder

At Gedhe Endhase, we believe fashion should not come at the cost of our planet. Born from the Indonesian words “Gedhe" (great) and "Endhase"( his head), our name embodies our mission: to courageously redefine style by turning coffee waste into bold sustainable, luxurious fashion in a innovative way. We are more than a brand—we are a movement, stitching innovation, ethics, and environmental stewardship into every thread.

The Problem We Solve
The fashion industry is one of the largest polluters globally, while coffee consumption leaves behind mountains of discarded grounds and husks. At Gedhe Endhase, we saw these two challenges as an opportunity. Instead of letting coffee waste rot in landfills or contribute to textile pollution, we transform it into coffee leather—a biodegradable, durable, and stylish alternative to animal or synthetic leather. Every jacket, bag, or accessory we create diverts waste from the environment and reduces the carbon footprint of fashion.

Our Innovation
Using cutting-edge technology, we process coffee waste into premium materials that rival traditional leather in quality and aesthetics. Our products are lightweight, antibacterial, and free from toxic chemicals, proving that sustainability and luxury can coexist. From coffee farms to your wardrobe, we ensure every step of our process honors the Earth and empowers communities.

Core Values
- Sustainability First: We prioritize circular practices, from sourcing raw materials to recyclable packaging.
- Ethical Collaboration: We partner with local coffee farmers and suppliers (noteably The Bell Society) and artisans, ensuring our community welfare and fostering a circular economy.
- Transparency: We educate consumers about the journey of their products, because mindful choices start with awareness.
- Relentless Innovation: We push boundaries to prove eco-friendly materials can lead, not follow, in the fashion world.

Our Team: Passion Meets Purpose
Behind Gedhe Endhase is a young, dynamic team driven by a shared commitment to the planet. From our CEO’s strategic vision to our COO’s meticulous production oversight, every leader brings expertise honed through academic accolades, organizational leadership, and a deep understanding of sustainability. Together, we blend creativity, science, and ethics to craft fashion that inspires change.

Join Our Journey
Our vision is bold: to set a global standard for environmental responsibility in fashion. With every purchase, you’re not just buying a product—you’re supporting a future where style and sustainability are inseparable.
